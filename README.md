# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Here is a high-level overview of how you can create an artificial intelligence project for credit card fraud detection using Python.

1. Collect and prepare the data: First, you will need to collect a large dataset of credit card transactions, including both fraudulent and legitimate transactions. You will then need to clean and preprocess the data, which may involve handling missing values, converting data into a suitable format, and scaling numerical features.

2. Explore and visualize the data: Next, you will want to explore and visualize the data to get a better understanding of the patterns and trends in the data. This can help you identify any anomalies or suspicious activity that may indicate fraudulent transactions.

3. Build a model: Once you have prepared the data, you can then use machine learning algorithms to build a model that can accurately predict whether a given credit card transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. There are many different algorithms you can use for this task, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

4. Train and evaluate the model: Once you have built a model, you will need to train it using the prepared data. You can then evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. You may need to fine-tune the model by adjusting the hyperparameters or using a different algorithm to achieve better results.

5. Deploy the model: Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it to a production environment where it can be used to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time.


We have to import the necessary libraries, including pandas for loading and manipulating the data, train_test_split for splitting the data into training and test sets, StandardScaler for scaling the features, RandomForestClassifier for building the model, and confusion_matrix and classification_report for evaluating the model's performance.
